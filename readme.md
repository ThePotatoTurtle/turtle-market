# TurtleMarket - A Discord Prediction Market Bot

A lightweight, Discord-based prediction market platform for small groups. Powered by a centralized Automated Market Maker (AMM) using the **Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR)**, this bot lets you create, trade, and resolve YES/NO markets entirely within Discord.

---

## Features

- **Create Markets**: `/create_market` lets admins set up new YES/NO markets with custom market IDs, bet topic, details and conditions, and LMSR liquidity parameter **b**.
- **View Markets**: `/markets` lists all active markets. `/resolved` lists markets already resolved. `/details <id>` shows more information about a specific market. 
- **Trade**:
  - **Buy**: `/buy <id> <Y|N> <amount>` spends dollars to purchase YES/NO shares from the market (AMM).
  - **Sell**: `/sell <id> <Y|N> <percent>` sells a percentage of your YES/NO shares back to the market (AMM).
- **Portfolio**:
  - `/cash` shows your current cash balance.
  - `/port` shows cash, open bets, and total portfolio value.
- **Transfers**: Admins can `/deposit` and `/withdraw` to top up or withdraw funds, respectively. `/send <@user> <amount>` allows users to send cash to each other. 
- **Resolution**: Admins run `/resolve <id> <Y|H|N>` to resolve a market. Winners get \$1 per share, losers get \$0.
- **Help**: `/help` displays all non-admin commands.

## LMSR AMM

LMSR provides continuous pricing via a convex cost function, avoiding order books. Key formulas:

1. **Cost Function**

   `C(q_Y, q_N) = b * ln(exp(q_Y/b) + exp(q_N/b))`

   - **q_Y, q_N**: total YES/NO shares sold
   - **b**: liquidity parameter (higher = more liquidity, less slippage)

2. **Marginal Price**

   `P_YES = exp(q_Y/b) / (exp(q_Y/b) + exp(q_N/b))`
   
   `P_NO = 1 - P_YES`

3. **Buying $A**: solves for Δq such that

   `C(q_Y+Δq, q_N) - C(q_Y, q_N) = A`

   giving you Δq shares for $A.

4. **Selling**: you earn

   `C(q_Y, q_N) - C(q_Y-Δq, q_N)`

   by returning Δq shares.

This design ensures **instant liquidity**, **bounded loss for the MM**, and **smooth price changes** even for erratic markets.
